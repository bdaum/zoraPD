<h2>Microsoft Computer Vision<br>
 </h2>At the time of writing the <span style="font-style: italic;">Microsoft Computer Vision</span>
was still in an early state. Nevertheless it was useful. In addition in
providing categories and keywords, it can also check for safe content,
detect faces, and provide image description one-liners.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Microsoft</span> offers several
pricing plans, starting with a free plan. At the time of
writing the free plan allowed for 5000 image requests per month.
Microsoft also limits the number of requests to 20 per minute.
Therefore, ZoRa PhotoDirector waits three seconds until issueing the
next request.<br>
<br>

<h4>Options</h4>

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maximum number of proposals.</span> 
For each image <span style="font-style: italic;">Microsoft Computer Vision</span>
proposes a small number of categories and a larger number of keywords. You
may restrict both by setting a maximum number of proposals.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Minimum confidence level.</span>
All proposals are given with a confidence level. You may enter a value
between 0 and 100 (in percent) to supress all proposals with a lower
confidence level. Note that this setting applies only to keywords but not to categories.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pre-mark keywords when confidence is above.</span>
Specify a confidence level for which the system should automatically
mark proposals as keywords. Specify a value of 100 if you do not wish
