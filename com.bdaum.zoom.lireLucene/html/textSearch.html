<h2>Text Retrieval</h2>

Text retrieval (<acronym>Image&gt;Text search</acronym>) is quite
similar to a Google search and allows searching for text phrases in
images regardless
if the phrase occurs in the keywords, in a title, a description, a
slide, exhibit, or web exhibit using that image, etc. Text retrieval
allows for very quick text searches but does not have the precision of
a specific query such as a keyword query. For example, if you search
for "Peter" you will find all images with a keyword "Peter" but also
all images where "Peter" is found in the author, owner, or copyright
field - or any other field, that is.<br>

However, by combining multiple sub queries into one query expression
you can narrow down your search results:<br>

<ul style="font-weight: normal;">

  <li>Search for <span style="font-weight: bold;">phrases</span> by
including them into double quotes, e.g.<code> "uncle tom"</code>.</li>
  <li>Use <span style="font-weight: bold;">wildcard</span> operators
such as&nbsp;* and&nbsp;? (not within
phrases).&nbsp;* stands for any string,&nbsp;? for a single arbitrary
character. <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> You cannot use a * or
? symbol as the first character
of a search.<br>
Examples: <code>ani*</code> would find all words starting with
'ani'.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Postfix
a word with ~ to perform a <span style="font-weight: bold;">similarity</span>
search. This can be useful to get
search results even in the case of spelling errors.</li>
  <li>Use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">AND</span> operator for
returning images containing both words or phrases, for example: <code>people
AND animals</code>.</li>
  <li>Use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">OR</span> operator for
returning images containing either the left or the right word or phrase
but not both: <code>people OR animals</code></li>
  <li>Use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> operator for
excluding images containing a word or a phrase. For example <code>people
NOT animals </code>would return images tagged with 'people' but not
tagged with 'animals'. Alternatively, you can write <code>people
-animals</code>.</li>
  <li>Use parentheses for <span style="font-weight: bold;">complex
search expressions</span>, for example: <code>(people AND animals) OR
(cars AND animals)</code></li>
  <li>Some characters contained in a search word or phrase must be <span style="font-weight: bold;">escaped</span>: <code>+ - &amp;&amp; || !
( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \</code><br>
Prefix such characters with \, for example: <code>wow\!</code></li>
</ul>
