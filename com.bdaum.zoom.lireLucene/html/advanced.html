<h2>Advanced Search</h2>
The optionally installed advanced search functions comprise the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Free text search</span>. You can
search for any text occuring in the context of an image: e.g. keywords,
headlines, text in slides, exhibits, and other texts. Which text
elements are indexed for search can be configured in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Catalog Properties</span>, section <span style="font-weight: bold;">Indexing</span>. You can use <a href="textSearch.html">search expressions</a> and the results will contain a score to indicate the likeliness of a match.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Content based search</span>. You can search for images based on the visual similarity of a given image. For each <a href="SearchSimilarDialog.html">search request</a>
it is possible to combine keyword and content based search and to
modify the given image using paint tools. The algorithms used can be configured in the  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Catalog Properties</span>, section <span style="font-weight: bold;">Indexing</span>. <br>
    <br>
Image similarity is based on color, texture and shape. Different
algorithms interpret those features in different ways. Which algorithm
is suited best depends on your image set. Landscape images, for
example, will require a different algorithm as company logos. You can
index your images with multiple algorithms and then, when searching,
try out several algorithms to find out which works best for your
images. But beware of using to many algorithms for indexing because
this slows down the indexing process.<br>
    <br>
A special case are AI algorithms (marked with <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="neural" src="images/neural.png">) such as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Clarifai</span>
algorithm. These algorithms don't use low level functions but compare
high level image concepts obtained from a deep neural network. Here the
similarity is rather semantic than visual. The downside is that these
services typically require a web service. When indexing, each image
will generate a web service request. For large catalogs this may exceed
the capacity of free web service accounts, so a paid account would be
needed.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<br>

The search field in the main toolbar accepts both keyword expressions
and images which you can simply drag into the field. If the Advanced
Search feature is not installed, the search field performs keyword
searches.<br>
<br>
Both text search and content based search use the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> search engine. The content based search, in addition, is based on the <a href="http://www.lire-project.net/">Lire</a> libraries.<br>
