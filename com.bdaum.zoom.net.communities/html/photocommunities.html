<h2>Photocommunities </h2>

<p>Photocommunities are a popular option to publish images on the
Internet. Before being able to upload images to such a community you
must create an account with them and enter the account details into
ZoRa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The amount and maximum size depends on the particular
community. Usually, free communities tend to limit the amout and size
of images more than commercial communities. Communities also differ in
their support for albums (photosets) and categories and the method of
access authorization. Please refer to the help pages of a particular
community for details. </p>
