<h2> Exporting to Internet Photo Communities </h2>

<p>Exporting to <span style="font-style: italic;">Internet Photo
Communities</span> is invoked via&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">File&gt;Export...&gt;Communities&gt;....</span></p>

<p>You may either export selected images or export all images of a
slideshow, exhibition, or web gallery selected in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Catalog View</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>

<p>Before being able to export images to a photo community you must
first create a new account or select an existing account::</p>

<ul style="font-weight: normal;">

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Name</span>. The account name as
agreed with the service provider.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Web URL</span>. The web URL of
the specific account. This is used for displaying the account content
after images have been uploaded.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Track exports</span>. Check this
box if uploads should be recorded with each image. Later, you may view
these records in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Properties</span>
view under &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">File&gt;Track</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Privacy</span>.
The varous settings for the privacy of the whole account depends on the
specific community. Typical are different restriction levels (private,
private and friends, private and family, public).</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Metadata</li>
  <ul style="font-weight: normal;">
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assign keywords as Tags</span>.&nbsp;Check
this box if tags should be automatically created from keywords.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create Photosets from albums</span>.&nbsp;Check
this box if photosets should be automatically created from albums.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>The following options are available for the export operation:<br>
</p>

<ul>

  <li>You have the choice to send either <span style="font-weight: bold;">originals</span> (which may be
rather large)
or to downsize the images and compress them into the popular <span style="font-weight: bold;">JPEG</span>
format. Raw and DNG files can only be uploaded if the particular
community supports this.</li>

  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">size</span> of these JPEGs
can be adjusted using the scale. Alternatively, you
may enter a maximum size (either width for landscape orientation or
height for portrait orientation).</li>
  <li>You can sharpen the downsized JPEGs to
counterbalance the loss in sharpness due to the down-sampling process.
An <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unsharp Mask filter</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>is
used for that purpose, where you can adjust the pixel radius, the
sharpening strength, and a threshold value.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: normal;">You can set the <span style="font-weight: bold;">JPEG quality</span> between 1 for low
visual quality and small storage size and 100
for best visual quality and large storage size. The default value of 75
combines good compression with virtually no visible artifacts.</span></li>
  <li>If you want to include <span style="font-weight: bold;">metadata</span>
(EXIF and IPTC) into the
generated JPEG
files, check the option "Include metadata". On the following wizard
page you can then select the metadata that you want to export. You may
include geodata as well to support geotagging.</li>
  <li>Optionally, you may add <span style="font-weight: bold;">watermarks</span>
for the protection of you
intellectual property to images (not when uploading originals).</li>
</ul>
