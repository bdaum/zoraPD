<h2>Trackpoints </h2>Trackpoints are usually obtaiined from a GPS
device such as a car GPS or a GPS tracker. Typically, a trackpoint GPX file
obtained from such a device contains multiple tracking "sessions"
separated by larger gaps or waypoints.<br>When importing a trackpoint file you may edit the trackpoints by marking the option<acronym> Edit trackpoints</acronym>
in the <a href="geoTagging.html">GPS preference page</a>. You are then shown a specific dialog
listing all subtracks contained in the imported files. You have several
options for editing these subtracks before applying their trackpoints
to your images:<br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit subtrack.</span>
You may want to modify start and end of the selected subtrack. The
effect is the same as modifying the tolerance of the first or last
trackpoint within this subtrack.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove subtracks.</span>
Removes the selected subtracks from the list. The trackpoints contained
in these subtracks are not considered for tagging images.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Join subtracks.</span>
Joins the selected subtracks to one subtrack. The effect is the same as
modifying the tolerance of the trackpoints at the gaps between the
joined subtracks. This can be useful for a longer trip where the tracker had been switched off for longer intervals.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Split subtrack. </span>You
may define a gap that separates the selected subtrack into two
subtracks. The trackpoints contained in this gap are not considered for
tagging images.</li></ul><br>These changes are not permanent - the original GPX or NMEA files are not modified.
