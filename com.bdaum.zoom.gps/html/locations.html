<h2> Locations </h2>

<p>The IPTC standard defines different locations that can be defined
for an image:</p>

<ul style="font-weight: normal;">

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Location created</span> (<acronym>IPTC&gt;Administration&gt;Location created</acronym>)
indicates the camera position when the image was taken. The location
entries are created automatically when geo-tagging images.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Location shown </span>(<acronym>IPTC&gt;Origin&gt;Location created</acronym>)
can contain several locations displayed in the image. These locations
are usually created manually.</li>
</ul>

Each
location consists of hierarchical place names (world region, country,
state, city, sub location) and/or coordinates. <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span>
maintains a list of already defined locations for quick selection. New
locations may be defined by pressing the <abbr>Add...</abbr><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>button and entering their details
or by
locating them on the map. To do so, first press the <abbr><span style="font-weight: bold;">Map... </span></abbr>button, then click on
the
green marker in the top region of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Map
dialog</span>, and then on the location in the map.<br>

<br>

Locations can be viewed and edited through the menu function <acronym>Catalog&gt;Properties&gt;Locations</acronym>.
