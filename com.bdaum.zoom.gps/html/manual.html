<h2>Manual Geotagging </h2>

<p>Geo-tags can be applied manually. Select the images in question, then
switch to the <a href="maps.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Map
view</span></a>.
Click on the leftmost pin in the top region, then follow the instructions. You may apply this operation to a
single image or to several images in one step.</p>
<p>When working with a single image you may also define the image
direction (the direction in which the camera was turned) by clicking
onto the direction pin.<br>
</p>


<p>If
an image
already is geo-tagged, its location is displayed as a marker. You can
change this location by dragging the marker into a different location.
Alternatetively, you may also set a new marker by clicking on the
leftmost pin in the top region. This will, however, change the position
of ALL selected images.<br>
