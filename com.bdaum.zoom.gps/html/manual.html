<h2>Manual Geotagging </h2>

<p>Geo-tags can be applied manually. Select the images in question, then
switch to the <a href="maps.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Map
view</span></a>.
Click on the pin in the top region, then follow the instructions. You may apply this operation to a
single image or to several images in one step.</p>

<p>If
an image
already is geo-tagged, its location is displayed as a marker. You may
set a new marker to change the current position.
However,
this is only possible with single images or with images that all have
the same coordinates.</p>

<p>In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Map view</span> you usually
work in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Lock mode</span>.
By toggling the <abbr>Lock</abbr> button (<img style="width: 21px; height: 16px;" alt="schloss" src="images/closedlock.png">) in
the views tool bar you can unlock the
view. This means that the view content will not change when the image
selection changes. This mode facilitates the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Map view</span> for other purposes than
geo-tagging.</p>
