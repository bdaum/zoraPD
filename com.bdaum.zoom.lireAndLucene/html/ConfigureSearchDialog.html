<h2>Configure Search Dialog</h2>

This dialog is used to specify the
search options for the global search field in the main menu bar. This
affects both
similarity search and text retrieval. The settings are similar to the <a href="SearchSimilarDialog.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Similarity
Search Dialog</span></a>
without the possiblity to edit the reference image and the keywords.
Instead, these items are taken from the image dropped into the global
search field.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

<h4>Search algorithm</h4>

Which search algorithm is
the best, depends very much on the character of your images. For
example, in a catalog containing mostly texture images, you may want to
use the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tamura texture</span>
filters. With the average photographic content
we found the methods <span style="font-style: italic;">CEDD</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">FCTH&nbsp;(</span>or their
combination <span style="font-style: italic;">JCD</span>)
quite efficient. The<span style="font-style: italic;"> Auto Color
Correlogram</span> is a modern search algorithm also providing very
good results.<br>

<br>

Please note, that you can only use algorithms in a query that are
supported by your catalog. Which algorithms are supported can be
configured in the <a href="catProperties.html#indexing">catalog
properties</a>.
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

Each query
returns with each image a score between 0 and 100 percent. You may
limit the
amount of returned images either by <span style="font-weight: bold;">number</span>
or by specifying a minimum
<span style="font-weight: bold;">score</span> that must be satisfied by
each matching image.<br>

<br>

<h4>Search for</h4>

To search only for visual
similarity specify a keyword weight of 0, to search only for keywords
specify a weight of 100. For a combined search specify any value
between 1 and 99.<br>
