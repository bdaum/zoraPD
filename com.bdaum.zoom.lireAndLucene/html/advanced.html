<h2>Advanced Search</h2>
The optionally installed advanced search functions comprise the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Free text search</span>. You can
search for any text occuring in the context of an image: e.g. keywords,
headlines, text in slides, exhibits, and other texts. Which text
elements are indexed for search can be configured in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Catalog Properties</span>, section <span style="font-weight: bold;">Indexing</span>. You can use <a href="textSearch.html">search expressions</a> and the results will contain a score to indicate the likeliness of a match.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Content based search</span>. You can search for images based on the visual similarity of a given image. For each <a href="SearchSimilarDialog.html">search request</a>
it is possible to combine keyword and content based search and to
modify the given image using paint tools. The algorithms used can beconfigured in the  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Catalog Properties</span>, section <span style="font-weight: bold;">Indexing</span>. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>

The search field in the main toolbar accepts both keyword expressions
and images which you can simply drag into the field. If the Advanced
Search feature is not installed, the search field performs keyword
searches.<br>
<br>
Both text search and content based search use the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> search engine. The content based search, in addition, is based on the <a href="http://www.lire-project.net/">Lire</a> libraries.<br>
