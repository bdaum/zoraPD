<h2>Search Similar Dialog</h2>

This dialog is used to specify example picture and search options for
the similarity search. <br>

Content
based image retrieval (CBIR) is a long established research area. There
are many&nbsp;known search&nbsp;methods (<span style="font-weight: bold;">algorithms</span>). We have selected some
modern search algorithms that seem to be suitable for photographic
images. <br>

None of these algorithms are actually able to retrieve the&nbsp;meaning
of an image. For example, the algorithm does not see the
trees within a forest picture, but evaluates low level features such as
overall color, spatial distribution of color, color histograms,
textures, and so on. So, you should not expect too much from this
function - it can certainly not replace a keyword search. However,
in many situations it can be very useful, especially if you combine it
with a keyword search.<br>

<br>

Similarity
searches can be performed locally or across a network of peers. They
can also be restricted to the current collection, so that can in fact
combine similarity searches with other metadata searches (collections).
After executing a similarity search, you can also save it as a live
collection (use <acronym>Save as collection</acronym> in the gallery
view drop down menu).<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>When
working in a networked group and performing queries across the network,
the various catalogs should all support the same similarity algorithms.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> For a quick search just
drag an image to the search field in the menu bar.<br>

<h4>Reference image</h4>

The search is
based on an <span style="font-weight: bold;">reference image</span>
which is presented in the dialog. If no image
was selected, a white background is presented. You may use the drawing
tools (pencil, airbrush, pipette) to create a new drawing or to modify
the reference image. <br>

<br>

<h4>Search algorithm</h4>

Which search algorithm is
the best, depends very much on the character of your images. For
example, in a catalog containing mostly texture images, you may want to
use the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tamura texture</span>
filters. With the average photographic content
we found the methods <span style="font-style: italic;">CEDD</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">FCTH&nbsp;(</span>or their
combination <span style="font-style: italic;">JCD</span>)
quite efficient. The<span style="font-style: italic;"> Auto Color
Correlogram</span> is a modern search algorithm also providing very
good results.<br>

<br>

Please note, that you can only use algorithms in a query that are
supported by your catalog. Which algorithms are supported can be
configured in the <a href="catProperties.html#indexing">catalog
properties</a>.
Choosing many algorithms will give you much choice during image
retrieval but will slow down indexing and use more disc space. <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

Each query
returns with each image a score between 0 and 100 percent. You may
limit the
amount of returned images either by <span style="font-weight: bold;">number</span>
or by specifying a minimum
<span style="font-weight: bold;">score</span> that must be satisfied by
each matching image.<br>

<br>

<h4>Additional keywords</h4>

By
specifying keywords an a keyword weight of more than 0, you can combine
the similarity search with a keyword search. The keywords are taken
from the currently selected image or are typed in. The more keywords
match an image, the higher the score. To search only for visual
similarity specify a keyword weight of 0, to search only for keywords
specify a weight of 100.<br>
