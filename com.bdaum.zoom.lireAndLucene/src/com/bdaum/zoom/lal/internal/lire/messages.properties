
Constants_CEDD = Color & Edge Directivity Descriptor (CEDD)

Constants_CEDD_Explanation = CEDD uses color and texture information based on MPEG-7 descriptors.\r\nIt provides very good overall results.

Constants_FCTH = Fuzzy Color and Texture Histogram (FCTH)

Constants_FCTH_Explanation = FCTH uses color and texture information based on wavelets. \r\nIt provides very good overall results with emphasis on color contrasts.

Constants_Gabor_Explanation = Gabor Texture Filters analyze the texture of an image using wavelets.

Constants_JCD = Joint Composite Descriptor (JCD)

Constants_JCD_explanation = JCD is a combination of CEDD and FCTH. Thus it uses color and texture information based on wavelets and MPEG-7 descriptors. \r\nIt provides very good overall results.

Constants_JPEG = JPEG

Constants_JPEG_explanation = Similarity based on JPEG coefficients

Constants_MPEG7_Explanation = Combines the three other MPEG-7 descriptors. \r\nIt achieves reasonable overall results.

Constants_PHOG = PHOG

Constants_PHOG_explanation = PHOG combines histograms of edges in several spatial pyramid levels

Constants_Tamura = Tamura Texture (Coarseness, Contrast and Directionality)

Constants_Tamura_Explanation = Tamura Texture Filters analyze the texture of an image to find similar images.

Constants_auto_color = Auto Color Correlogram

Constants_auto_color_explanation = Similarity based on an auto color correlogram. This reflects the spatial relationship between colors.

Constants_color_histogram = Color histogram

Constants_color_histogram_explanation = Image similarity is based on the similarity of the images color histograms.

Constants_color_layout = MPEG-7 Color Layout Descriptor

Constants_color_layout_Explanation = MPEG-7 Color Layout Descriptor analyzes the spatial layout of colors. \r\nTypically it finds images with a similar spatial distribution of colors.

Constants_conbined_mpeg7 = Combined MPEG-7 Descriptors

Constants_edge_histogram = MPEG-7 Edge Histogram Descriptor

Constants_edge_histogram_Explanation = MPEG-7 Edge Histogram Descriptor analyzes the direction of edges in the image. \r\nTypically it finds images with a similar graphical structure.

Constants_gabor = Gabor Texture

Constants_joint_histogram = Joint histogram

Constants_joint_histogram_explanation = A joint histogram combining 64-bin RGB and pixel rank

Constants_luminance_layout = Luminance layout

Constants_luminance_layout__explanation = Similarity based on luminance. Intended for grayscale and B/W images

Constants_opponent_histogram = Opponent histogram

Constants_opponent_histogram_explanation = A color histogram based on the Opponent Color Space. Opponent color spaces are closer to the human eye than, for instance, the RGB color space.

Constants_overall_color = Overall color

Constants_overall_color_Explanation = Finds images with the same overall color impression. \r\nCan be useful if you want to combine images with similar color characteristics.

Constants_scalable_color = MPEG-7 Scalable Color Descriptor

Constants_scalable_color_Explanation = The MPEG-7 Scalable Color Descriptor utilises an HSV color histogram. \r\nTypically it finds images with similar color contrast.
