    <h2>Email preferences </h2>
    <p>For sending emails from ZoRa PhotoDirector you have two options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the platforms <b>email clien</b>t. The advantage is that you have
        access to your address book when specifying receivers. The disadvantage
        is that you must perform an additional step. Also, under some platforms,
        the process is a bit cumbersome. Under Windows, ZoRaPD generates due to
        technical limitations an email message which you must then explicitly
        forward to the receivers, </li>
      <li>Don't use the platforms email client. In this case ZoRaPD does the
        email sending itself. To enable ZoRaPD for this task you must specify
        the necessary parameters: <b>Host address</b>, <b>Port number</b>, <b>Security
          method</b>, <b>User ID</b>, <b>Password</b>, and <b>Sender email</b>.
        Use the values obtained by your email service provider.<br>
        In addition, you may specify a <b>signature </b>to be appended to the
        message text and a <b>vCard </b>to be attached to each email.</li>
    </ul>
