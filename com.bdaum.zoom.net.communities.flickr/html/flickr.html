<h2> Flickr accounts </h2>

<p>Access to <span style="font-style: italic;">Flickr</span> accounts
is by explicit authorization. The first time when accessing the service
you will be asked to manually log-in into your accout. <span style="font-style: italic;">Flickr</span> will show
you the <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span>
is asking for permission to access your site. By granting access you
will enable <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa</span> to upload
images. If by any reason&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa
Photo Director</span> should loose this permission, you will be asked
again to grant permission.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Flickr</span> accounts <br>

<ul style="font-weight: normal;">

  <li>enforce size and transmission limits that are shown on page <span style="font-style: italic;">Capacity</span> of the account dialog.</li>
  <li>allow an image being placed in multiple albums similar to what is
possible in the <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span>.</li>
  <li>support geocoding and tagging</li>
  <li>do not support categories</li>
  <li>Only professional accounts allow for the replacement of images. <br>
When
uploading an image twice on a free acount, two copies will be stored in
your <span style="font-style: italic;">flickr</span>-gallery. You may
then want to delete the older copy
manually.</li>
