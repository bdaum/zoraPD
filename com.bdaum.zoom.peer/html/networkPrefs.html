<h2>Networking Preferences </h2>
The networking preferences are invoked via <acronym><a href="networkPrefs.html">Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Network</a><sup>*</sup></acronym>.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Own address</span></h3><ul><li>
Here you find your own network address. </li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Computer
name (IP address)</span>. For information only. This field cannot
be modified.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Port</span>.
The communication port used. Normally you should use the provided
default value. However, in some cases the port may already be in use,
for example if another peer is running on the same computer. In this
case choose a different value. You must restart the application after a port change.</li></ul></ul>
<h3><a name="cat"></a>Shared catalogs</h3>
Here you
list all catalogs that can by accessed by other peers but also by
yourself when performing a network search across multiple peers and/or
multiple catalogs.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Use the <abbr>Add</abbr> button to add a new
catalog to the list. That can be the currently opened catalog but also
any other <code>.zdb</code> catalog on your computer. By
clicking the new entry in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Privacy</span>
column you can adjust the privacy setting for the catalog:</li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">All</span>.
All images in the catalog can be accessed by remote peers.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Medium</span>.
Only images classified as public or medium can be accessed by remote
peers.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Only public
elements</span>. No restricted images can be accessed by remote
peers.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Local</span>.
The catalog is not accessible by remote peers. This is the typical
setting for performing local searches across multiple catalogs without
opening to catalog to remote peers.</li>
</ul>
<li>Use the <abbr>Access Rights</abbr>
button to reduce or extend the access rights of specific remote peers
to the selected catalog. (You cannot add restrictions to catalogs with
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Privacy</span>
setting "Local").<br>
By default each peer can search a catalog and
view the results in full resolution.</li>
<ul>
<li>Mark <span style="font-weight: bold;">Search</span>
to allow the peer search the catalog.</li>
<li>Mark <span style="font-weight: bold;">View</span>
to allow the peer to view items in full resolution</li>
<li>Mark <span style="font-weight: bold;">Voice
note</span> to allow the peer to replay voice notes</li>
<li>Mark <span style="font-weight: bold;">Copy</span>
to allow the peer to copy an item to his own node. (If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Voice note</span> is not
marked, attached voice notes are not copied.)</li>
</ul>
Removing all
marks will close the catalog for the specific peer.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
Access
rights definitions will always affect the complete peer computer but
not a single port!<br>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use the <abbr>Remove</abbr> button to remove
the selected access rights or the selected catalog from the list.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="peer"></a>Peer nodes</h3>
<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Peers
included in network search operations</span><br>
Here you set up a list of all peers that you want to include into a
network search:</li>
<ul>
<li>Use the <abbr>Add</abbr>
button to add a new peer to the list. Specify the peer's computer name
and communication port. If you want to use an IP address instead of the
computer name make sure that the peer uses a fix IP address. Some
operation systems allocate a different IP address after each new start.</li>
<li>Use the <abbr>Remove</abbr> button to remove
the selected peer definition from the list.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<h3><a name="incoming"></a>Incoming calls</h3>
Here
you can monitor which other peers have accessed your catalogs. If you
do not want a certain peer to access your catalogs, simply select him
in the list and click the <abbr>Toggle blacklist</abbr>
button. Another click re-establishes the access rights of that peer.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
Blacklisting will always affect the complete peer computer but not a
single port!<br>
<br>
By clicking the <abbr>Clear</abbr> button you can remove
all entries from the list - except the blacklisted entries.&nbsp;<br>
