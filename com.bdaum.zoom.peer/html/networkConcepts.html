<h2>Networking concepts </h2>

<p>Provided that the networking component had been installed, many
search dialogs show a "Search in network" button. &nbsp;When checking
this option, searches are performed simultanously across multiple peer
nodes and catalogs. Otherwise, only the currently opened catalog is
searched.</p>Network searching is possible with<br><br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">user defined</span> permanent collections</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">adhoc</span> collections and other adhoc queries such as time search, similarity search, etc.</li></ul><br>Network searching is NOT possible with<br><br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">system</span> collections (time line, directories, etc.)</li><li style="font-weight: bold;">albums</li><li style="font-weight: bold;">person albums</li></ul><br><h3>Providers and Consumers</h3>Each peer nodes acts both as a provider and as a consumer:<br><ul><li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">provider</span>
provides the access to one or several of his own catalogs. Each
provider can define different privacy levels for the shared catalogs
and can restrict or extend the access rights for specific
consumer/catalog combinations. See&nbsp;<acronym><a href="networkPrefs.html">Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Network&gt;Shared Catalogs</a><sup>*</sup></acronym></li><li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">consumer</span>
can have access to catalogs offered by other providers. For this
purpose he defines a list of peers that should be accessed during a
network search.&nbsp;<br>See&nbsp;<acronym><a href="networkPrefs.html">Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Network&gt;Peer nodes</a><sup>*</sup></acronym></li></ul><br><h3>Remote and local searching</h3>Network searches are performed differently on local and remote nodes:<br><ul><li>On
remote peer nodes all shared catalogs not specified as "Local" or
searched providing the particular consumer is allowed to perform a
search. The result is filtered according to each catalogs privacy
settings.</li><li>On the home node the currently opened catalog is searched as well as all shared catalogs without any restrictions.</li></ul><br>Non-network searches are only performed on the currently opened catalog.<br><br>
