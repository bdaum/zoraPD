<h2>Sharing catalogs </h2>If your own node does not define <span style="font-style: italic;">Shared Catalogs</span>,
other nodes - even if they specify you as a peer - do not have access
to your catalogs and resources. To make catalogs available for other
peers, you must explicitely define them in the list of <span style="font-style: italic;">Shared Catalogs</span>. <br>&nbsp;See&nbsp;<acronym><a href="networkPrefs.html#cat">Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Network&gt;Shared Catalogs</a><sup>*<br><br></sup></acronym>However,
sharing catalogs does not only make catalogs accessible to other peers.
It allows yourself to search for images across multiple of your own
catalogs. If you want to do such a multiple catalog search but do not
want to make catalogs accessible to other nodes, simply put them into
the list of <span style="font-style: italic;">Shared Catalogs</span> but set their Privacy to "Local".<br><br>"Local"
is the most severe privacy setting. The other values such as "All",
"Medium", or "Only public images" are used to restrict the set of
images returned on peer queries according to the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Privacy</span> setting in the metadata of each image (<acronym>Properties&gt;ZoRa Photo Director&gt;Privacy</acronym>). Local queries are not restricted by this setting.<br><br>Finally, the <a href="access.html">operations</a> performed by other peers can be restricted or extended for each <span style="font-style: italic;">Shared Catalog</span>
for each peer computer separately. As a matter of fact this makes only sense for
non-local catalogs (the own node always has full access to all
catalogs). <br>
