<h2>Network troubleshooting </h2>If a network search or another network access does not perform as expected, check the following:<br><ol><li>Make sure that the peers you want to access are in the list of peers. (&nbsp;See&nbsp;<acronym><a href="networkPrefs.html#peer">Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Network&gt;Peer nodes</a>*</acronym>).
Make sure that the computer name and the port number are valid. If you
use IP addresses make sure that the IP address of the peer has not
changed.</li><li>Make sure that the peers are online. In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Status</span> column in&nbsp;<acronym><a href="networkPrefs.html#peer">Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Network&gt;Peer nodes</a>*</acronym>&nbsp;you can see which peers are online and which are not.<br>It is a good idea to start all peer <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa PhotoDirector</span> applications when the operating system starts (<span style="font-style: italic;">Autostart</span>) and to execute the program in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tray</span> mode (<acronym><a href="networkPrefs.html">Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Application</a>*</acronym>).</li><li>Make
sure that the required catalogs are shared by your peers and that you
have the necessary rights to perform the operations wanted. You need to
talk to your peers or to your network administrator.</li></ol>
