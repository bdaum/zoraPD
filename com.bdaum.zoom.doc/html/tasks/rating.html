Image rating or ranking allows you to classify your images according to
their quality. How quality is defined is up to you: technical quality,
aesthetical quality, commercial quality, etc. Industry standard are six
rating levels from 0 to 5.<br>
<br>
<h4>Importing rated images</h4>
When you import images into a catalog, its rating is imported as well.
The rating can be defined within the image file or in an XMP sidecar
file.<br>
<br>
<h4>Rating a single image</h4>
The most obvious way to rate a single image is to click on the rating symbol <img style="width: 15px; height: 16px;" alt="rating" src="../images/rating_undef.png"> in the top right corner of the images thumbnail image. Another way is to select the image and invoke the <acronym>Rate...</acronym>
menu or context function.Or drag the image onto a rating collection in
the Catalog view. Finally, you may also press a key shortcut, by
default <abbr>Ctrl</abbr>+<abbr>Shift</abbr>+<abbr>T</abbr>.<br>
All these actions bring up the rating dialog box where you either click on a rating symbol or press one of the keys <abbr>0</abbr>, <abbr>1</abbr>, <abbr>2</abbr>, <abbr>3</abbr>, <abbr>4</abbr>, <abbr>5</abbr>, or <abbr>*</abbr> ( * for <a href="../reference/rating.html">automated rating</a>).<br>
<br>
<h4>Rating many images collectivly<br>
</h4>
Applying the same rank to several images can be done in almost the same
way, except the use of the thumbnail rating symbol. Simply select
several images, then invoke the <acronym>Rate...</acronym> menu or context function or press the rating key shortcut. Or drag the images onto a rating collection in the Catalog view. <br>
<br>
<h4>Rating many images individually</h4>
The most comforable way to do this is to run a slide show on the selected images. As you go press one of the keys  <abbr>0</abbr>, <abbr>1</abbr>, <abbr>2</abbr>, <abbr>3</abbr>, <abbr>4</abbr>, or <abbr>5</abbr>.
The slide show automatically continues after a short while.
Alternatively, you may also move the mouse to bring up the slide show
control panel and invoke the rating dialog box from there.<br>
