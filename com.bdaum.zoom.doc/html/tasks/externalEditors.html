<h2>Invoking external editors and viewers </h2>
<p>This
application is all about image browsing and retrieval. It leaves the
task of modifying images to specialized image editors such as
<span style="font-style: italic;">Photoshop</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Paint Shop Pro</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Picture Window</span>, and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using a keyboard shortcut (<abbr>Ctrl+E</abbr>) you can
invoke&nbsp;such editors on the selected images quickly. But before you
are able to do that, you must <a href="../reference/fileAssociations.html">associate</a>
those editors with file types (<acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;File
Associations<sup>*</sup></acronym>).
Each file type may be opened with a different editor. For example, RAW
files can automatically be opened with a RAW converter while TIFF files
are opened with a classic image editor. You may even assign several
editors to the same file type and then, by pressing <abbr>Ctrl+Shift+E</abbr><span style="font-weight: bold;">,&nbsp;</span>select
one of these editors from a list.</p>
<p>When
double-clicking an image, the image will be opened in a full-screen
viewer. If you did not define an external viewer, the internal viewer
will be used. This viewer&nbsp;can display all supported file types in full resolution. If you want
instead to use your favorite third-party viewer, you must specify its
location under <acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;General<sup>*</sup></acronym>.
You will still be able to invoke the internal viewer by pressing&nbsp;<abbr><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shift</span> </abbr>&nbsp;while
double-clicking.</p>
