      <h2>Importing images
      </h2>
      <p>To add images to the catalog you have to import them. You can</p><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li>import <span style="font-weight: bold;">single images</span>. Invoke (<acronym>File&gt;Import...&gt;File ...</acronym>) and select one or several files. Alternatively you may <span style="font-weight: bold;">drag</span> image files into an image area such as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Lightbox</span> view or the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sleeves</span> view. Then you can choose between leaving the images at their original
position or importing them into a new folder structure. In the later
case
the images are copied from the source folder to the target folder. It
is possible to <span style="font-weight: bold;">rename</span> the imported
images during that process.</li><li>import <span style="font-weight: bold;">whole folders</span>.&nbsp;Invoke (<acronym>File&gt;Import...&gt;Folder ...</acronym>)
and select a folder. Alternatively you may <span style="font-weight: bold;">drag</span> a folder into an image area
such as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Lightbox</span> view or the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sleeves</span>
view. Then you can choose between leaving the images at their original
position or importing them into a new folder structure. In the later
case
the images are copied from the source folder to the target folder. It
is possible to <span style="font-weight: bold;">rename</span> the imported
images during that process.</li><li>import from a <span style="font-weight: bold;">device</span> (<acronym>File&gt;Import...&gt;From Device ...</acronym>) such as a Memory Card or a connected Digital Camera.&nbsp;Invoke (<span style="font-style: italic;">File&gt;Import from Device ...</span>).
After <a href="../reference/importFromDevice.html">selecting the images to import</a> and specifying a target folder,
the images are copied from the device to the target folder and are
imported into the catalog. It is possible to<span style="font-weight: bold;"> rename</span> the imported images during that process.</li><li>import <span style="font-weight: bold;">analog images</span>  (<acronym>File&gt;Import...&gt;Analog images ...</acronym>).
This function allows you importing images that have been scanned in.
Typically, these images do not contain metadata such as EXIF and IPTC
data. Therefore, you are prompted with a dialog allowing you to enter
vital metadata to be added to the imported images.</li></ul><h3>Keeping the catalogue up-to-date</h3>To keep your catalog up to date, you have the option (<acronym>Catalog&gt;Properties...&gt;Watched Folders</acronym>)
to add folders to a list a watched folders. Whenever a new image is
added to a watched folder, it is automatically imported into the
catalog. Modifications of images are detected, too: a modified image
will be re-imported into the catalog. Alternatively, you have the
option to synchronize selected images manually (<acronym>File&gt;Refresh...</acronym>).<br><br><h3>Imported data</h3>During
the import of images, a thumbnail and the meta data (EXIF and IPTC) are
extracted and added to the catalog. The original images are not
required to view the catalog, so you can work with removable media.
However, some highres-operations such as Editing, Viewing, Slide show,
or Exporting
require that these media are mounted.<br><br><h3>Remote images</h3>Images
that have been uploaded to FTP accounts or to web-sites can be added to
the catalog, too, to keep track of them. (This is not possible for
images uploaded to photo communities such as flickr because photo
communities usually deny direct access to uploaded images.) When
required, remote images are downloaded automatically.<br><br><h3><a name="raw"></a>Raw images</h3>By default,
thumbnail images are derived directly from the high-res original
image.&nbsp;RAW- und DNG-images need a conversion which is performed on
the fly. Because this may take quite some time, you may opt to derive
thumbnails from the preview images contained in the RAW- or DNG-files.
This will speed up the import process considerably, but the results are
quite different. You may want to try both options for your images
before deciding for a specific variant (<a href="../reference/importPrefs.html"><acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import<sup>*</sup></acronym></a>).<br>
<br>
Currently, <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> supports two raw converters: DCRAW and RawTherapee.<br><br><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li><span id="result_box" class="" tabindex="-1" lang="en"><span class="">DCRAW is a program that is normally started from the command line.</span> <span class=""><span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> integrates DCRAW and calls it up with the appropriate parameters as needed.</span></span></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Windows
and MacOS distributions of <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> come with a built-in version of <span id="result_box" class="" tabindex="-1" lang="en"><span class="">DCRAW</span></span>.
      <a href="../reference/dcraw.html">Newer&nbsp;DCRAW versions</a> can simply be dropped into the subfolder <code>dropins/</code> of the installation folder.<br></li>
    <li>On Linux platforms you should install&nbsp;DCRAW into <code>/usr/bin</code>. You can also install into the sub folder&nbsp;<code>dropins/</code> or specify a location under <a href="../reference/importPrefs.html"><acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import&gt;RAW Conversion</acronym></a><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span> You can find a&nbsp;DCRAW  version for your Linux system via&nbsp; <a href="http://linuxappfinder.com/package/dcraw">http://linuxappfinder.com/package/dcraw</a>.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Alternatively, you can use <span style="font-weight: bold;">RawTherapee</span> for raw conversion. This must be installed separately. You must specify the location of the <span style="font-style: italic;">RawTherapee</span> executable under <a href="../reference/importPrefs.html"><acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import&gt;RAW Conversion<sup>*</sup></acronym></a><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>DNG</h4>DNG
files can automatically be&nbsp;derived when importing RAW images to allow for an integrated RAW work flow.<br>Before doing so, please set the location of your DNG converter (<a href="../reference/importPrefs.html"><acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import&gt;DNG Conversion<sup>*</sup></acronym></a>). You can download a copy of the free <span style="font-style: italic;">Adobe DNG Converter</span> from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/">www.adobe.com/products/dng/</a>.
<br>When deriving DNG files you have the option, to embed the original RAW
file into the DNG file (The <span style="font-style: italic;">Adobe DNG Converter</span> can extract the
original RAW file from such a DNG file), to import both RAW- and
DNG-file side by side (default), or to import only the DNG version. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> This
functionality is not available under Linux, because there is no
Linux-version of the Adobe DNG converter.<br>
<br>
<h4>Raw Recipe Reflection (3R)<br>
</h4>
Raw and DNG images are typically processed with a RAW converter such as
<span style="font-style: italic;">Adobe Camera Raw</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Adobe Lightroom</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Apple Aperture</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Capture One</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">DxO</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Helicon Filter</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">RawTherapee</span>, and others. The corrections that you make
in those converters are, however, not applied to the raw image file,
but are stored in a separate and fairly small metafiles (<span style="font-style: italic;">recipe</span>). As a matter of
fact&nbsp; each raw converter sports its own recipe format and its own
way of storing this file.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director </span>is
able to detect the recipes of some raw converters and to re-apply the development parameters to raw images as
they are imported or displayed. You should, however, not expect a
perfect match with the image developed with the original raw converter.
The aim is to provide an approximate visual impression how the raw
image will look. In particular, <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> does currently not re-apply partial corrections or the correction of distortions.<br>
<br>
This recipe detection and processing can be configured under <acronym><a href="../reference/importPrefs.html">Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import&gt;RAW Conversion<sup>*</sup></a></acronym><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
If a recipe is found for an image, this is reflected in the status of the image:<br>

<br>

RAW image without recipe: <span style="font-weight: bold;">RAW</span><br>

DNG image without recipe: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Converted</span><br>

RAW or DNG image with recipe: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Corrected<br>
<br>
</span>Because one can build <a href="imageRetrieval.html">search queries</a> on the status of image, you can easily separate between non-corrected and corrected RAW images.<br>
<br>
<br>



<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><sup>*)</sup> On Mac use <acronym>ZoRa Photo Director&gt;Preferences&gt;...</acronym><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
