<h2>Catalog maintenance</h2>The main menu offers several functions for catalog maintenance:<br><br><ul><li><acronym>Catalog&gt;Maintenance...&gt;Split catalog...</acronym>
&nbsp;allows you&nbsp;transferring a selection of images into a new
catalog and to remove those images from the current catalog.&nbsp;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example</span>:
The current catalog contains images from several photographers. You
want to split the catalog by photographer. Start an adhoc search (<acronym>Metadata&gt;Adhoc search...</acronym>) for<span style="font-style: italic;"> IPTC&gt;Artist.</span> Then call <acronym>Catalog&gt;Maintenance...&gt;Split catalog...</acronym> You may also split a subset of the images shown by selecting single images.</li><li><acronym>Catalog&gt;Maintenance...&gt;Merge catalogs...</acronym> allows you combining two catalogs into one. Several options are provided how to handle duplicates.</li><li><acronym>Catalog&gt;Maintenance...&gt;Recreate index</acronym>
can be used to refresh a catalogs Lucene index. This index is used for
similarity search and text retrieval. Only use this function if you
have reason to believe that the index is corrupt (wrong search results
during similarity search or text retrieval).</li><li><acronym>Catalog&gt;Maintenance...&gt;Restrore...</acronym>
can be used to restore a catalog from a back-up. You may restore even a
different catalog from the currently open catalog. After the catalog
has been restored, it is opened.</li>
  <li><acronym>Catalog&gt;Maintenance...&gt;Migrate...</acronym>can be
used to migrate a catalog to a diffrerent platform (e.g. Windows to
Linux). In the process the folder structures can be changed, too.
However, you need some knowledge in regular expressions to use the
function.<br>
