<h2>Retarget operation<br>
 </h2>Retargeting is only necessary when image files were physically moved outside of <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span>,
so that catalog entries had become orphaned. The retargeting operation
is therefore only offered in the context menu of orphaned thumbnails. <br>The
retargeting operation allows you to update the selected image, or all
images in one of the parent directories of that image - including
subfolders. In the process it may create a new directory structure in
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Catalog View</span>.<br>Optionally, you can also retarget voicenotes if you had moved voicenote files together with their images.<br><dl><dd><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hint:</span> You can easily find orphaned catalog entries via menu function <acronym>Catalog&gt;Search...&gt;Orphaned Entries</acronym>.<br></dd><dd><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hint 2:</span> You can also retarget an orphaned catalog entry by dragging the target file onto the orphaned entry and keeping the <abbr>ALT</abbr>-key pressed.</dd></dl>
