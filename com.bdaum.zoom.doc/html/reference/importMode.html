<h1 style="text-align: left;">Import Mode</h1>When importing images you have the choice between two strategies:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Import in situ.</span> WIth this
option all imported files stay at their original location. A catalog
entry pointing to the file location is created for each of these files.<br>
This even possible for removable media. When the medium is removed the
catalog entry appears as an offline entry but all operations that
require the high-resolution image will fail. Mounting the medium again
will fix this problem.<br>
Another problem in this mode is the (unlikely) creation of DNG files
during RAW file import from read-only media. This is not possible and
will create an error message.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Import into new folder structure.</span> When choosing this option you are prompted to specify the target folder. All imported files are <span style="font-weight: bold;">copied</span> into that target folder. The file copies can be organised into subfolders of the target folder, depending on your choice.<br>
In addition, all files can be renamed by choosing an appropriate
renaming template. If no renaming is wanted choose "Original file name".<br>
  </li>
</ul>

Please note the when importing from a device the import is always performed into a new folder structure.<br>
