<h2> Views </h2><p class="Para" label="Type">Views show different aspects of the image catalog or of single images and image groups.</p>
<p class="Para" label="Type">Views&nbsp;have their own menus. To open the menu for 
a view, click the triangle icon on the view's title bar. Some views also 
have their own tool buttons on the title bar. The actions represented by these buttons 
only affect the items within that view. <br>
</p>

</p>

<p class="Para" label="Type">A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other 
views in a tabbed notebook.&nbsp;You can change the layout of a perspective by 
opening and closing views and by docking them in different positions in the 
Workbench window.&nbsp; </p><h3>Opening views</h3>
Perspectives offer pre-defined combinations of views. To open a 
view that is not included in the current perspective, select <acronym>Window&gt;Show 
View</acronym> from the main menu bar.<h3>Moving and docking views</h3>
To change the location of a view in the current perspective: 
<ol><li>Drag the view by its title bar. Do not release the left mouse button yet. 
</li><li>As you move the view around the <span style="font-style: italic;">Workbench</span>, the mouse pointer changes indicating the effect of the move operation.To see the 
drop cursor change, drag the view over the left, right, top, or bottom border of 
another view. You may also drag the view <i>outside</i> of the 
Workbench area to turn it into a "Detached" view that sits on the desktop. 
</li><li>When the view is in the location that you want, release the left mouse button. 
</li><li>Note that a group of stacked views can be dragged using the empty space to 
the right of the view tabs. </li></ol><h3>Working with multiple windows</h3>You
may also drag a view to a location outside the workbench. A separate
application window containing the view will be created on the desktop.
To return to the old layout, simply drag the view back to its original
location.<br>
<h3>Creating fast views</h3>

Fast views are hidden views that can be quickly opened and closed. They work 
like other views except they do not take up space in your <span style="font-style: italic;">Workbench</span> window. 
<p>To create a fast view perform a right click on the view tab and check the option <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fast View</span>.</p>
<p>The icon of a fast view appears on the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Fast 
View bar</span> (bottom left in the status bar). You 
can show the view by clicking its icon. As soon as you 
click somewhere else outside the view, the fast view is hidden again.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 229px; height: 26px;" alt="fast view bar" src="../images/fastviewbar.png"><br>
 </p>

<p>To restore the view to its original location (and remove it from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Fast 
View bar</span>), toggle the fast view item in the view button's context menu.</p> <h3>Maximizing and minimizing views</h3>
<i>View Stacks</i> (each containing one 
or more views) can be maximized or minimized.
There is a variety of ways to access 
these operations:
<ol><li>Double click a view tab to maximize its stack. Another double click will restore its original size and position.</li><li>Use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Minimize</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maximize</span> buttons provided at the right hand side of the stacks title bar. 
</li><li>Selecting the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Minimize</span> or&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Maximize</span> item on the context (right-click) 
menu for a stack</li></ol>When a view stack is minimized it appears as a <span style="font-style: italic;">Trim stack</span>, a collection of icons representing the minimized views. This <span style="font-style: italic;">Trim stacks</span> are located in the margins of the workbench next to the original position of the stack. With a click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Restore</span> button of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Trim stack</span> you may restore the view stack to its original size and position.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>You can always return to the intial layout of the current <a href="perspective.html">perspective</a> by selecting the <acronym>Window&gt;Reset Perspective</acronym> menu function.<br><h3>Save your changes</h3>After adding or rearranging views in&nbsp;the current perspective, you may wish to save your new 
layout by clicking <span class="command-link"><img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png"> <acronym><span style="font-style: italic;">Window &gt; Save
