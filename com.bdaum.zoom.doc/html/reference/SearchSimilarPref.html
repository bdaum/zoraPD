<h2>Search Similar Preferences</h2>
This preference page allows you selecting among different similarity
<span style="font-weight: bold;">algorithms</span>. When you select an algorithm, a short description is
displayed below the selection field. Which search method is
the best, depends very much on the character of your images. For
example, in a catalog containing mostly texture images, you may want to
use the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tamura texture</span>
filters. With the average photographic content
we found the methods <span style="font-style: italic;">CEDD</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">FCTH</span>
quite efficient. <br>
<br>
Each query
returns with each image a score between 0 and 100 percent. You may limit the
amount of returned images either by <span style="font-weight: bold;">number</span> or by specifying a minimum
<span style="font-weight: bold;">score</span> that must be satisfied by each image.<br>
<br>
The section <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advanced Options</span>
allows you configuring the indexing process. Only the selected
algorithms will later be available for search. The number of selected
algorithms will determine the size of the index and the speed of
indexing.<br>
