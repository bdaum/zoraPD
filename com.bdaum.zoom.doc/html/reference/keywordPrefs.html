<h2> Keyword preferences </h2>
<p>The list of filter expressions on this page determines which
keywords will be added to the list of&nbsp;defined keywords (as displayed
in the <a href="catProperties.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Catalog Propertie</span>s</a>)
in the catalog when images are imported. Some photographic tools, for example,
include the GPS coordinates into the images keywords. Adding all of
these to the list of defined keywords would lead to a huge and noisy
keyword list.&nbsp;</p>When a new keyword is about to be added to the list of
defined keywords, the filter expressions are compared to the new
keyword one by one beginning at the top of the list. When an expression
matches with the keyword, the keyword is either rejected or accepted,
depending on the definition of the filter expression. If the filter
expression does not match, the keyword will be compared with the next
filter expression in the list, and so on. If none of the filter expressions match, the keyword is accepted.<br>Filter expressions may contain wildcards:<br><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li>'*' matches with any string of arbitrary length<br>
</li><li>'?' matches with one and only one character</li></ul></body></html>
