<h2>Rules for automatic creation of collections</h2><h4>Group</h4>This attribute is for convenience only for restricting the number of displayed fields. If in doubt select <span style="font-weight: bold;">All</span>.<h4>Field</h4>Each rule must refer to exactly one metadata field such as the EXIF field for <span style="font-style: italic;">exposure time</span> or the IPTC field for <span style="font-style: italic;">model age</span>.
Not all existing metadata fields are offered here, in particular fields
that are already used for system collections (such as the IPTC creation
date that is reflected in the timeline collections) are not available
for the definition of rules.<h4>Type</h4>The type of a rule is derived from the metadata field selected:<br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discrete</span>. The field only has a few possible values such as the EXIF field<span style="font-style: italic;"> flash_fired</span>.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Linear</span>.
Field values are distributed in a linear fashion. It makes sense to
create collections with&nbsp;value ranges equal in size. This type can
also cover negative values. A typical example is the field EXIF field
for<span style="font-style: italic;"> light_value</span>.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exponential</span>.
Field values are distributed exponentially. It makes sense to create
collections with value ranges steadily growing in size, so that
collections can cover both very small values and very large values. A
typical example is the EXIF field for <span style="font-style: italic;">exposure time</span>. This type cannot cover negative values.</li></ul>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Parameter</span><small></small></h4><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li>Rules with <span style="font-weight: bold;">discrete typ</span>e do not have parameters.</li><li>For rules with<span style="font-weight: bold;"> linear type</span>
you can specify the with of the equidistant value ranges. For example,
if you specify an interval size of 2 for the EXIF field light_value,
the light values 0 and 1 will be grouped into one collection, the
values 2 and 3 into another collection, and so on. <br>Alternatively, you may specify intervals explicitely as a semicolon separated list such as <span style="font-style: italic;">0; 2; 5; 8; 16</span></li><li>For rules with<span style="font-weight: bold;"> exponential type</span>
you
can specify the base value of an exponential series. For example, if
you specify 2 as base value, this would result in an interval series
such as ...; 0.25; 0.5; 1; 2; 4; 8; .... &nbsp;Accordingly collections
would be created with value ranges of 0.25 - 0.5; 0.5 - 1; 1 - 2; 2-4;
4-8 and so on.<br>Alternatively, you may specify intervals explicitely as a semicolon separated list such as <span style="font-style: italic;">0; 2; 5; 8; 16.</span></li></ul><p></p><p></p>
