<h1 class="Head">Automatic Rating</h1>Automatic image rating is performed with the help of Internet based rating services. Currently, only <a href="https://www.clarifai.com">Clarifai</a> is supported as rating service. Clarifai provides several so-called models such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Landscape</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Portrait</span>, or <span style="font-style: italic;">Focus</span>. Images are always rated in respect to such a model.<br>
<br>
The result of an image evaluation is a rating value between 0 and the
maximum rating value. We recommend a maximum rating value for automatic
rating of 3. So, the automatic rating process can result in values
0,1,2, and 3, while the values 4 and 5 may be applied manually after
visual inspection.<br>
You may opt to rate all selected images or only those that are currently not rated.<br>
