these folders are transferred to their target destination:<br><br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Metadata.</span> The values in these fields are added the the metadata of each image that is imported.</li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Artist</span>.

artists use the same transfer folder. It is good practise that each
artist uses a different transfer folder.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">File source</span>.
Define how the image was created, e.g. a scanner or a digital camera.
Set this field to <samp>Unknown</samp> when the images in this transfer folder are
generated by different sources. It is good practise to use different
transfer folders for each file source.</li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skip duplicates</span>.
Set this option if you do not want to import the same file twice. If
you do not check this option, the image will be imported again but
stored under a slightly modified name.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skipped file types</span>.
Use this option to skip certain file types. For example if your camera

files.</li></ul><acronym></acronym>
