<h2>Import Conflict Resolution dialog </h2>
<p>When importing images it may happen that certain images were already
imported previously. This conflict can be resolved in several ways:</p><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skip image.</span> This option will skip the image to be imported and move on to the next image to import.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overwrite catalog entry.</span> &nbsp;The conflicting catalog entry is completely deleted before the image is imported again.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synchronize with catalog entry.</span>
The catalog entry is overwritten only in parts by the new import. Which
parts are overwritten can be selected with the following options:</li></ul>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh Thumbnail.</span> This
option will update the catalog thumbnail and is typically used after
images have been updated with an image editor or after the thumbnail
size or sharpening had been changed. However, refreshing will
be much faster if this option is switched off.  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh image
status</span>.
    <span style="font-style: italic;">De-select</span> this group if you have manually modified status, color code,
rating, content type, privacy settings, or user fields and don't want to reset that information.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh EXIF data.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">De-select</span> this group if the EXIF data have not changed. For example, you may only want to refresh the GPS data.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh GPS
data</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">De-select</span> this group if you have geo-tagged the image
and you do not want to reset that information.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh IPTC
data</span>.
    <span style="font-style: italic;">De-select</span> this group if you have manually entered keywords, categories
and other IPTC data and you do not want to reset that information.</li></ul>


</ul><br>You may resolve these conflicts step by step, or apply the
chosen policy to all future conflicts within the current import process
by checking the option <abbr>Apply to all conflicts</abbr>. In addition, you may mark <abbr>Only newer items</abbr>, too, to process only items that have been modified after being previously imported into the catalog.
