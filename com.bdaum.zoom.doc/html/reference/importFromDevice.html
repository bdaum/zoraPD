<h2>Import from device dialog</h2>
<br>Importing from a device requires that a device is connected to the
computer and that it is mounted as a removable drive. The drive folder
must contain a <code>DCIM/</code> sub folders. Suitable devices are, for
example, digital cameras connected via an USB port, memory cards
inserted into the card reader, and so on.<br>
The import options are specified with the help of a wizard:<br>
<h4><a name="1"></a>Step 1, File selection</h4>
The top section of this wizard page contains a tree&nbsp;organizing the files based on their <span style="font-weight: bold;">modification date</span>. This allows selecting images by their creation date. Only supported file types are considered, however.<br>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't import duplicates</span>.
Check this option if you want to avoid that duplicates are imported into the catalog.
Detection is performed by comparing the original filename and the
modification date of the file. A warning is written into the <a href="logView.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Log file</span></a> if a duplicate was detected.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skip JPEG when RAW file exists</span>. Some cameras can create both RAW and JPEG files with the same shot. You may want to skip the JPEG file if a RAW file exists.<br>
  </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove media after import</span>.
Check this option if you want the removable drive to be dismounted
after import has finished. The camera or memory card can safely be
disconnected thereafter.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Step 2, Output target selection</h4>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<li>In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Transfer to</span> entry
specify the target folder where you want the images to be stored. The
images selected in step 1 will be copied to the target folder during
the import process.&nbsp;</li><li>In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create subfolder</span> entry you may opt to have sub folders created, either <samp>by year</samp>, by <samp>year and month</samp>, <span style="color: black; font-weight: normal;">by</span><samp> year, month and day</samp>, or not at all.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Step 3, File renaming</h4>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Imported files can and should be renamed during the import. The renaming process is controlled by a <a href="templates.html">template</a>. There are several predefined templates but you can also add (<abbr>Add...</abbr>) your own and edit (<abbr>Edit...</abbr>) templates. In the <var>Cue</var> field you may want to supply a short string that will replace <code>{cue}</code> variables within templates.<br>

<h4><a name="4"></a>Step 4, Metadata options</h4>
In the last step, the metadata of the imported images may be completed
by adding additional entries. Advanced options allow restoring the
metadata of RAW images.<br>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Add metadata</li>

  <ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Artist</span>. Photographer or artist who created the imported pictures.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Event</span>. The event documented by the imported images.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keywords</span>. Keywords to be added to the imported photos.</li>
  </ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advanced Options</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li style="outline-color: navy ! important; outline-style: dashed ! important; outline-width: 2px ! important;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling prefix for EXIF transfer. </span>If a
file prefix is specified, EXIF data is transferred from JPEG to RAW
files if both file names begin with this prefix and differ only in the
file name extension. Usually the prefix would be <code>IMG_</code>.
Typically this option is used when the camera delivers RAW files
without EXIF information (for example CHDK enhanced cameras). Please mark the option <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skip JPEG when RAW file exists </span>in step 1 if you do not want to import the JPEG files but only the RAW files.<br>
</li></ul></ul><br>
