<h2>Refresh dialog </h2>
<p>The menu function <acronym>File&gt;Refresh...</acronym>
re-imports selected files. In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Refresh
dialog</span>, you can specify what to refresh:</p><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Re-import&nbsp;existing images.</span>
This will allow you to update images that are already in the catalog.
This is typically used after an image had been modified by another
program. Another option is to use <a style="font-style: italic;" href="metadata.html">Watched Folders</a> to detect changes automatically.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include up-to-date images.</span>
This option is normally not used. It should only be used after a new
program version has introduced new attributes or corrected attributes, or when thumbnail size or sharpening was changed in the <a style="font-style: italic;" href="catProperties.html">Catalog Properties</a>.
Using this option, all catalog entries can be updated with new or
corrected attributes.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove missing images from catalog.</span> This is used to remove catalog entries for which no image file exists (<span style="font-style: italic;">orphans</span>).</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include remote images</span>.
Check this option to images that are stored remotely on
some server on the Internet, too. This option can slow down the <span style="font-style: italic;">Refresh</span>
operation considerably because images must be downloaded to the local
computer.</li></ul><p>You can determine, too, which information groups should be refreshed. You may
not want to refresh groups where you already have edited image meta data manually.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh Thumbnail.</span> This
option will update the catalog thumbnail and is typically used after
images have been updated with an image editor or after the thumbnail
size or sharpening had been changed. However, refreshing will
be much faster if this option is switched off.  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh image
status</span>.
    <span style="font-style: italic;">De-select</span> this group if you have manually modified status, color code,
rating, content type, privacy settings, or user fields and don't want to reset that information.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh EXIF data.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">De-select</span> this group if the EXIF data have not changed. For example, you may only want to refresh the GPS data.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh GPS
data</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">De-select</span> this group if you have geo-tagged the image
and you do not want to reset that information.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh IPTC
data</span>.
    <span style="font-style: italic;">De-select</span> this group if you have manually entered keywords, categories
and other IPTC data and you do not want to reset that information.</li>
</ul>
