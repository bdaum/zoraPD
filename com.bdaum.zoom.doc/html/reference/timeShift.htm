<h2>Apply time shift<br>
</h2>
This function is typically used to correct EXIF time stamps when the
camera was set to a wrong time or time zone. The specified shift value
is applied to all selected images. It is applied to the following
fields:<br>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
  <li>EXIF image creation date</li>
  <li>EXIF file modification date but only if equal to the image creation date<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The modifications are applied to the ZoRa Photo Director catalog. Image files are not
modified but the new values are used when XMP files are created.<br>
