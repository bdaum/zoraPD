<h2>Find Series</h2>
This function is used to find time series within the catalog. Several
options allow fine-tuning this search:<br>
<br>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Series type</span>: Choose from the following series types:</li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">All</span>. No specific type. All series satisfying the criteria explained below are shown.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exposure bracket</span>. Series with variying exposure (light value) but constant subject distance and focal length.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Focus bracket</span>. Series with variying subject distance but constant exposure and focal length. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note
that this series type does not work for many cameras (especially
compact camera) as these camera don't deliver the necessary EXIF data.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Zoom bracket</span>. Series with varying focal length but constant exposure and subject distance.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rapid fire</span>. Series with an interval of less than 250 msec between shots.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other</span>. Other series NOT falling into the above categories.</li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maximum
interval:</span> The maximum time interval (in seconds) between two
consecutive images. A time difference that is larger than the specified value is regarded as a break in
the series.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Minimum
length:</span> Series that are shorter than the specified length
are not shown.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Separate by
file format:</span> Typically, images of a series shot with a
digital camera have the same file format. This option helps to narrow
down the search to genuine series.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore
derived images</span>: This option restricts the search to
original images by excluding derived images such as the results of
RAW-to-DNG conversions or RAW development processes.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find within
current collection: </span>If checked, the search is restricted
to the current collection. If not, the whole catalog is searched.</li>
</ul>
