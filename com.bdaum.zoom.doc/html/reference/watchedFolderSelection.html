<h2>Watched folder selection</h2>Here you can add new folders to the
list of watched folders or modify the path of a defined watched folder.
You also must select the folder type:<br><br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Storage</span>. <span style="font-weight: normal;">When new images are added to such a
folder, the images are imported automatically into the catalog. When
images in such a folder are modified -&nbsp;for example by an external
editor - the images are automatically re-imported. However, only the
thumbnail is refreshed while the meta data in the catalog are kept intact.<br>The image file is not moved but stays in the specified folder.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transfer</span>.
Image files in such a folder are imported in the same way as images are
imported from a folder into a new folder structure. They do not stay in
their current location but are moved into a target folder and can be
renamed on the way. A typical scenario is a camera equipped with WLAN.
The camera will transmit a batch of images to a dedicated transfer
folder and <span style="font-style: italic;">Zora Photo Director</span> will automatically start processing these images.<br></span></li></ul><acronym></acronym>You can also choose to have subfolders watched or not. This optiion works recursively on subfolder of subfolders and so on, too.<br>
