archiving action copies the whole catalog including all image files and
associated files such as voice notes and raw recipes to another
destination. The chosen destination folder must be empty and must
accomodate the required space.<br><br>Depending on the catalog time the
copy process may last a long time during which the application cannot
be used for other purposes.<br><br>The resultung archive consists from
a (modified) copy of the catalog, the index files and
copies of the images and associated files. The original folder
structure is NOT maintained. Instead images may be renamed in case of
name clashes. On demand, the archived catalog and the archived files can be write-protected.<br><br>
