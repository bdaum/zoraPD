<h2>Keys preferences</h2>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Keys preference page</span> allows you configuring
keyboard shortcuts. Simply select a command in the table at the top (user defined entries are printed in bold) and enter the
key shortcut (in the same way as you would use it) in field <var>Key Sequence</var>. Special keys such as <abbr>Delete</abbr>, <abbr>Backspace</abbr>, or <abbr>Tab</abbr> can be inserted via the arrow button at the right hand side of the&nbsp;<var>Key Sequence</var> field.<br>If
a key sequence is assigned to more than one command, those commands
will appear in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Conflicts</span> area. Double click an entry there to
navigate to the command in question and change its key sequence.
