<h2>Tethered shooting<br>
</h2>Tethered shooting is a shooting mode where the camera is connected
to a host computer (e.g. laptop). When an image is shot it is
automatically transferred to the host computer and <span style="font-weight: bold;">deleted</span> from the cameras memory.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Not all cameras support
tethered shooting. The camera must be able to take pictures while it is
connected to a host computer via USB. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRaPD</span> supports tethered shooting for all cameras that do support the <a href="importFromDevice.html"><acronym>File&gt;Import&gt;from device</acronym></a> function. It can be started via the menu function <acronym>File&gt;Tethered shooting</acronym>. Alternatively, it can be started by connecting the camera to the host computer when the option<span style="font-weight: bold;"> On device insertion ... start tethered shooting</span> is set in <a href="importPrefs.html"><acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import&gt;General</acronym></a>.<br>
<br>
During tethered shooting the images coming from the camera are first placed into a transfer folder before they are processed by <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRaPD</span>. It is therefore necessary that you select a transfer folder as defined under <a href="catProperties.html"><acronym>Catalog&gt;Properties&gt;Watched Folders</acronym></a> or that you create a new one.<br>
<br>
After processing the transferred images appear in the collection <span style="font-weight: bold;">Imported&gt;Last background imports</span> (<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Last import" src="../images/lastimport.png"><img alt="Last import" src=",,/images/lastimport.png">) and can be viewed from there.<br>
<br>
Tethered shooting can be stopped by disconnecting the camera from the host or by invoking the function <acronym>File&gt;Tethered shooting</acronym> again.<br>
