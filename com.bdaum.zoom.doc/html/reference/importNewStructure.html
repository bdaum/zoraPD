<h2>Import into new folder structure<br>
</h2>
<br>Usually, when importing files and folders, all image files stay in their original
locations. However, by using the menu function <acronym>File&gt;Import...&gt;folder</acronym> and selecting "into new folder structure" files can be renamed and moved into a
new folder structure.<br>
<br>

The import options are specified with the help of a wizard:<br>

<h4><a name="1"></a>Step 1, File selection</h4>

The top section of this wizard page contains a tree&nbsp;organizing the files based on their <span style="font-weight: bold;">modification date</span>. This allows selecting images by their creation date. Only supported file types are considered, however.<br>

<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't import duplicates</span>.
Check this option if you want to avoid that duplicates are imported into the catalog.
Detection is performed by comparing the original filename and the
modification date of the file. A warning is written into the <a href="logView.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Log file</span></a> if a duplicate was detected.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="2"></a>Step 2, Output target selection</h4>

<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<li>In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Transfer to</span> entry
specify the target folder where you want the images to be stored. The
images selected in step 1 will be copied to the target folder during
the import process.&nbsp;</li><li>In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create subfolder</span> entry you may opt to have sub folders created, either <samp>by year</samp>, by <samp>year and month</samp>, <span style="color: black; font-weight: normal;">by</span><samp> year, month and day</samp>, or not at all.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="3"></a>Step 3, File renaming</h4>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Imported files can and should be renamed during the import. The renaming process is controlled by a <a href="templates.html">template</a>. There are several predefined templates but you can also add (<abbr>Add...</abbr>) your own and edit (<abbr>Edit...</abbr>) templates. In the <var>Cue</var> field you may want to supply a short string that will replace <code>{cue}</code> variables within templates.<br><br><h4><a name="4"></a>Step 4, Metadata options</h4>
In the last step, the metadata of the imported images may be completed
by adding additional entries. <br>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li style="font-weight: bold;">Add metadata</li><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Artist</span>. Photographer or artist who created the imported pictures.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Event</span>. The event documented by the imported images.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keywords</span>. Keywords to be added to the imported photos.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add to album.</span> This option
only appears when you drag files or folders into an album gallery. If
you do not want to add the images to the album remove the check mark
from the check box.</li>
</ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automated rating.</span> Check this option if you want to apply <a href="rating.html">automated rating</a> to all imported images.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
