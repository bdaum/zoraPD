    <h2>Section break properties</h2>
    The section break dialog allows you editing or defining several properties
    for individual section breaks, aka title slides. It typically describes the
    following section of slides until the next section break or the end of the
    slideshow. The following properties can be defined in excess of the standard
    slide properties: <br>
    <ul style="font-weight: normal;">
      <li><b>Title</b>. A title for the following section.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span> Some text
        describing the following section.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Layout</span>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Text only. </b>Only the title and the description are shown.</li>
        <li>T<b>humbnails left(right/top/bottom.</b> This will show an overview
          of the following slides within the title slide.</li>
        <li><b>Map left/right</b>. This will show a map of image locations of
          the following slides, provided that these images are geotagged. This
          feature is only available when the geo component was installed. Note,
          that an internet connection is required when playing the slideshow.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    The dialog also features a <b>Compile until</b> field. Select a number of
    slides to be analysed. Information such as the location, the creation date,
    model information, and artworks or objects shown is collected and placed
    into the <b>Description </b>field. In addition, a layout is proposed. You
    should use this function before entering other information as the <b>Description
      </b>field and the <b>Layout</b> field are overwritten.<br>
