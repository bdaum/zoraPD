<h2>File filter<br>
 </h2>The list of filter expressions in this dialog determines which
files (or subfolders) are accepted and which are not. When a file is tested with the
filter, the filter patterns are compared to the file name one by one
beginning at the top of the list. When a file name
matches with the pattern, the file is either rejected or accepted,
depending on the filter <span style="font-style: italic;">action</span>.
If the filter
expression does not match, the file will be compared with the next
filter pattern in the list, and so on. If none of the filter patterns
match, the file is accepted. FIlter patterns can be targeted on
individual files or on whole folders. This allows to accept or reject
subfolders within a directory structure.<br>
Filter expressions may contain wildcards:<br><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li>'*' matches with any string of arbitrary length<br>
</li><li>'?' matches with one and only one character</li></ul>The filter works case-independent.<br><br>Normally, the filter works only on the file or folder name. You may, however, also specify path patterns, such as <code>*/prod/*/final/*.* </code>Always use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">slash</span> as a path separator not the backslash. <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> The path pattern match is applied&nbsp;to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">relative</span> path of a file or folder, i.e. relative to some base folder such as a watched folder.<br>
