<h2>Managing catalog properties</h2>Many user preferences are catalog specific and are therefore managed in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Catalog properties</span> (<abbr>ALT+Enter</abbr>).<br><br>When
a new catalog is created you are asked to overlook the catalog
properties. By default, the properties of a new catalog are set to
default values. However, you have the option to inherit most of the
catalog properties from the currently opened catalog. Check <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use current catalog properties for new catalogs</span> to do so. <br><br></body></html>
