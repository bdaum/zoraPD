<h2>General preferences </h2>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Display</span></li>
  <ul style="font-weight: normal;">
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Output ICC-profile.</span>
With standard monitors you should leave this setting at <samp>sRGB</samp>. If you
use a Wide Gamut Monitor, switch to <samp>Adobe RGB</samp>. Otherwise colors could
look exaggerated. For cinematographic monitors the color profiles <samp>Rec. 709</samp>, <samp>Rec. 2020</samp>, <samp>DCI-P3</samp>, <samp>P3-D60</samp>,and <samp>P3-65</samp> are available.<br>
If correct colors are not an issue, switch to <samp>Disable CMS</samp> which will speed up the display of images. See also <a href="../concepts/CMS.html">Color Management</a>.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul style="font-weight: normal;">
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use quality interpolation</span>.
Check this option to utilize quality interpolation when viewing
high-res images. Otherwise, the faster nearest-neighbour algorithm will
be used, resulting in slight pixelation. Depending on the graphics
memory available, very large images might not display at all when
quality interpolation is used. In such a case switch back to normal
interpolation.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Processors used for image processing. </span>Specify
how many cores of you CPU are used simultanously for image processing.
High number lead to faster image processing but could temporarily slow
down other tasks.<br>
</li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Internal viewers</span></li><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Precede high-res image with preview image in internal viewer where possible.</span>
If this option is switched on, you will see an image of good quality
(the preview image) earlier, but the final high-res image will be shown
later due to the extra processing. Also, the preview image may differ
in color and brightness from the high-res image.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hide thumbnail JPeG artifacts in internal image viewer</span>.
When this option is checked, noise is added to the enlarged thumbnail
in the internal image viewer in order to hide the ugly JPeG artifacts.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enlarge small images to full screen.</span>
Mark this option if you want to small images in
a larger size than the original. The quality, however, may be bad.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use secondary monitor for image viewer</span>.
This option can be chosen on dual monitor systems when the main
workbench is run on the primary monitor. The internal image viewer will
then open on the primary monitor, the secondary monitor, or
alternatingly on both the primary and secondary monitor depending on
your choice.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Slideshow inactivity timeout.</span> Specify a maximum interval for pausing the slide show. If this interval is exceeded, the slide show is aborted.</li>



  </ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Backup and Program Update</li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Backup interval.</span>
Specify the number of days between each backup. The backup will be
performed silently. The backup location can be specified for each catalog
separately in the <a style="font-style: italic;" href="catProperties.html">Catalog Properties</a>.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maximum backup generations</span>. Please specify how many generations of backups you want to keep. Older backups will be deleted after a new backup was written.<br>
    </li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check for updates.</span> Determines when to check for new program versions. This can be done manually (<acronym>Help&gt;Check for Updates</acronym>) or automatically with each regular back-up (recommended) or on each program start.</li>
  </ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Miscellaneous</li>
  <ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Undo levels</span>. Determines how many steps can be undone. A high value will need more memory. The default value is 9.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supress progress indicator for background activities</span>. Mark this option to make background activities invisible.<br>
    </li>
