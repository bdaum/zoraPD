<h2>Keyword definition<br>
</h2>The tree in the main dialog area shows you which key words are applied to an image and which keywords are available.<br>

<br>
<ul>
  <li>Deselect a keyword in the "applied" branch to remove it from the
image or mark a keyword in the "available" branch to attach it to the
image.</li>
  <li>

New keywords can be entered in the text area at the bottom. When controlled vocabularies are defined (see <a href="catProperties.html#keywords"><span style="font-style: italic;">Catalog properties</span></a>), a button <abbr>Vocabularies</abbr> is shown for selecting a keyword from the those vocabularies.<br>
</li>
  <li>

At the top of the tree view you can switch between "flat" and "hierarchical". In
hierarchical mode the available keywords are grouped by their first
letter. In flat mode no grouping is performed.</li>
  <li>

At the bottom of the tree area you can select if you want to suppress
geographical keywords. This will exclude all keywords found in location
records (see <a href="catProperties.html#locations">Catalog Properties</a>). 
  </li>
</ul>
