<h2>Albums </h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Albums are similar to <a href="collectionEdit.html">collections</a> but they 
are not defined through queries. Instead, images are simply pulled from a <a href="galleries.html">gallery</a> into the album icon. The sequence of images within an album is determined by a sort expression, similar to the ordering of <a href="collectionEdit.html">collections</a>. If you require an image set where the sequence of images is determined on an image-by-image basis, use a <a href="slideshow.html">slide show</a> instead.<br>
<br>
An image may belong to 
several albums. To remove an image from an album, use the context 
function <acronym>Remove from Album</acronym> on the image thumbnail. <br>
<br>
To create a new album, use the 
context function <acronym>Create 
new Album</acronym> in the <a href="catalog.html">Catalog view</a>.<br>
