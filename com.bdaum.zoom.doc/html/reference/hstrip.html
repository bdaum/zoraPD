<h2>Horizontal Strip View </h2>
<p>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">Horizontal Strip View</span> works similar to the <a style="font-style: italic;" href="lightbox.html">Lightbox view</a>.
The main difference is that the size of the thumbnails cannot be
adjusted with a slider. Instead it is determined by the height of the strip - which, of
course, can be adjusted by dragging the sash separating the view from
its neighbors.<br></p>For&nbsp;key commands and mouse gestures please refer to the general <a href="galleries.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Galleries</span> </a>help page.<p> </p>
