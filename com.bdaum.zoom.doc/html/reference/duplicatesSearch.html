<h2>Duplicates Search</h2>There are several methods to search for duplicates. None is perfect:<br><br><ul style="font-weight: normal;"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Search by image name:</span>
A simple search by comparing the names of images.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Search by file name:</span>
A simple search by comparing the names of image files (last segment of the URI with or without the file name extension).</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Search by exposure data:</span>
Vital exposure data such as the creation date, camera type, exposure
time, aperture, and focal length are used to compare images. This may
fail for image series that are shot within the very same second and are
exposed identically. It, of course, does not work for images without
EXIF data such as images from analog media or screen shots.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Search by similarity:</span> The fastest search. It uses visual criteria to match images. These criteria are the same as in function <a href="SearchSimilarDialog.html">Content based search</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combined search</span>:
Uses a similarity match followed by excluding images not matching by
exposure data. This is the most precise matching algorithm, but also
the slowest one.</li></ul><br>Optionally, you can exclude derived
images from the search. For example, a DNG or TIFF image derived from a
RAW image would - without this option set - show up as a duplicate.
