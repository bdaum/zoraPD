<h2>Image Processing </h2>SInce Version 3, <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa PhotoDirector</span> makes use of the excellent <span style="font-style: italic;">twelvemonkeys</span>
image library. This library covers practically all of the popular image
formats and many more. For some additional file formats we use the
services of <span style="font-style: italic;">JAI</span> (Java advanced imaging), <span style="font-style: italic;">Jimi</span> (Java Image Management Interface), and <span style="font-style: italic;">ImageJ</span>. For information about RAW processing look <a href="raw.html">here</a>.<br>
<h4>Image size</h4>
There is no limit on the image size. However, since <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa PhotoDirector</span>
keeps images completely in memory, large image are subsampled. When
this happens depends on the main memory available. In consequence you
cannot enlarge this images to pixel level when using the internal image
viewer. If you require this feature, please embed an external image
viewer (<a href="../reference/fileAssociations.html"><acronym>Windows&gt;Preferences&gt;External Programs</acronym><sup>*)</sup></a>).<br>
<h4>JPEG 2000</h4>
Unfortunately, the JPEG 2000 license is not compatible with the GNU public license under which<span style="font-style: italic;"> ZoRa PhotoDirector</span> is distributed. Therefore, by default,  <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa PhotoDirector</span> comes without JPEG 2000 support. However, if you require JPEG 2000 support, you can download <code>com.bdaum.zoom.image.jpeg2000_1.2.0.jar</code> from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.photozora.de/pd/downloads/jpeg2000.jar">here</a>, and place it into the folder <code>ZoRa/plugins/</code> within your installation folder. Then restart the application.<br>
Note, that you must repeat this process after re-installing the application.<br>
<h4>WebP</h4>
WebP is a relatively new, Google-developed, open-source-based and free
format for image files. At the same quality, it compresses images much
better than JPeG. WebP is currently used mainly in the Goggle world
(Chrome, Android), but also by some other providers (Facebook, NetFlix,
Opera). <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa PhotoDirector</span> can import and export WebP files (export to folder or HTML).<br>
