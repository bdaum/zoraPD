<h2>Keywords, Vocabularies, and Categories<br>
 </h2>
Keywords and Categories are essential for classifying images. Both are
supported by IPTC metadata. Now, what is the difference between
keywords and categories?<br>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
  <li>Classification by categories is more general while the
classification by keywords is more specific. For example, the category
"Nature" or the subcategory "Mushrooms" covers a rather large field
while the keyword "Boletus aestivalis" pinpoints to a precise species.</li>
  <li>Categories are organized in hierarchies, for example<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mushrooms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Animals</code><br>
In <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director </span>all categories will show up as collections in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Catalog view</span>. Because of the hierarchical structure the collection "Plants" would also contain images from the collection "Trees".<br>
For keywords no such hierarchy exists. By default, no collections are
generated for the many keywords that may exist but you may define your
own collections for selected keywords.</li>
  <li>Typically an image can belong to exactly one main category. The IPTC standard allows in addition S<span style="font-style: italic;">upplemental Categories</span>. <br>
At the other hand, each image can be attributed with an unlimited number of keywords.<br>
  </li>
  
  <li>When a new catalog is created, a hierarchy of categories is automatically set up, depending on the catalog theme (see <a href="../reference/catProperties.html">Catalog Properties</a>) and based on the definitions in internal <code>categories*.ini</code> files. You may, however, overwrite these definitions by placing such files into the directory <code>dropins</code>
within the installation folder:<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; categories.ini<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; categories_food.ini<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; categories_travel.ini<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; categories_wedding.ini</code><code></code><br>
You may also later modify the category hierarchy interactively in the <a href="../reference/catProperties.html#categories">Catalog Properties</a>.<br>
A convenient way to create such files is to save the current category setup into a text file (<a href="../reference/catProperties.html#categories">Catalog Properties</a>) and then modify it with a text editor.<br>
<br>
In addition, files <code>keywords*.ini</code> may be added to folder <code>dropins </code>for populating a new catalog with keywords. For the file format, see below.</li>

</ul>A big problem with keywords is to avoid keyword cluttering because
this makes it difficult to retrieve images by keywords. One remedy is
to spell check all keywords which is done automatically in <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director </span>if a dictionary is defined&nbsp; (see <a href="../reference/catProperties.html">Catalog Properties</a>).<br>
Another remedy is to use <span style="font-style: italic;">Controlled Vocabularies</span>. These can be defined in the <a href="../reference/catProperties.html#keywords">Catalog Properties</a>. If controlled vocabularies are defined, <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director </span>will
flag all keywords that are not contained in a controlled vocabulary. On
the Internet there a many predefined controlled vocabularies, for
example here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://lightroom-keyword-list-project.blogspot.de/p/get-list.html">http://lightroom-keyword-list-project.blogspot.de/p/get-list.html</a><br>
or here<br>

You may of course roll your own, too.<br>
The file format for categories, keywords, and vocabularies is almost
identical and compatible with other application such as Adobe Lightroom.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Each category or keyword is contained in a separate line. </li>
  <li>Hierarchies are defined by indenting a subitem with a TAB character. </li>
  <li>Synonyms (used only for categories and vocabularies) are declared by enclosing an item with curly brackets. </li>
  <li>Groups (used only in vocabularies) are declared by enclosing an item with brackets. </li>
</ul>

Just have a look on one of the vocabularies found on the above mentioned web sites.<br>
