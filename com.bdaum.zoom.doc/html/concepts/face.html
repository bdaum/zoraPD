<h2>Face detection and recognition<br>
</h2>
<span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span>
does not provide facilities of its own for face detection and
recognition <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>but
relies on face data obtained from other sources such as&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Google's Picasa,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Windows Live
Photo Gallery, Adobe Lightroom</span> or the camera.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director </span>is able to handle face data from mixed sources. Face areas from different sources will be united to one area if appropriate.<br>
<br>Each person will be displayed as a separate album within the <span style="font-style: italic;">Persons</span> group.
Images where the face of a specific person was detected are added
automatically to the corresponding album. <br>
<br>It is possible to add and remove images to and from person albums in <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span>
freely. To add an image to a person album drag the image to the album
in the Catalog view. If you grab the image inside a region, the region
will be renamed to the name of the album. Otherwise, the unnamed region
closest to the mouse pointer will be renamed.<br>
Alternatively, you can click a region to add the image to a person album.<br>
<br>
Please be aware that the deleted entries can reappear in an album
as soon as the album is re-synchronized after a
corresponding Picasa album was modified.<br>
<h4>Metadata<br>
</h4>
When exporting metadata (XMP file) face related data is exported, too.
The formats used are the <span style="font-style: italic;">Microsoft
Photo Region Schema</span> as used by <span style="font-style: italic;">Windows Live Photo Gallery</span>, and the EXIF MWG format as used by <span style="font-style: italic;">Adobe Lightroom 6</span>.&nbsp;<br>
<h4>Queries<br>
</h4>
Because images are automatically added to person albums, it is not
necessary to define queries regarding persons. However, it is possible
to add person names to the IPTC keywords of an image via <acronym>Catalog&gt;Properties&gt;Keywords</acronym>,
so <a href="../reference/facePrefs.html"><acronym></acronym></a>
that images containing certain persons can be found easily via the <a href="../reference/keywordSearch.html">keyword search</a>.
In addition, images containing persons can also be found by using the <a href="../reference/textSearch.html">text search</a> facility (<acronym>Catalog&gt;Properties&gt;Indexing</acronym>).<br>
Another option is querying for images containing a given number of
faces (Group <span style="font-weight: bold;">Properties</span>,
Subgroup <span style="font-weight: bold;">Image,</span>
Field <span style="font-weight: bold;">No of detected
persons</span>). <br>
