<h2>Working with Raw images<br>
 </h2>The RAW image format is popular for many serious photographers.
The reason is, that other than the limited and lossy JPeG format, RAW
files contain all data captured by the cameras sensor.<br>
<br>
RAW images cannot directly be used for display or print purposes.
Instead, they need to be developed into a traditional image format such
as TIFF or JPeG using a <span style="font-style: italic;">Raw Converter</span>, for example <span style="font-style: italic;">Adobe Camera Raw</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Adobe Lightroom</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Capture One</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Raw Therapee</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Bibble</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">LightZone</span> and others.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, each camera manufacturer maintains its own RAW format.
In an attempt to standardize the RAW image format, Adobe has created
the DNG format (<span style="font-style: italic;">Digital Negative</span>).
A few camera manufacturers support this camera format directly, but in
most cases the the images delivered by the camera must be converted using
Adobe's <span style="font-style: italic;">DNG Converter</span>. Still,
these DNG images must be processed with a RAW converter to obtain
displayable images. However, not all RAW converters can convert DNG
files obtained with Adobe's <span style="font-style: italic;">DNG Converter</span>. So, our advice is to store RAW images both in the RAW format and in the DNG format.<br>
<br>
<h4>Basic RAW support</h4>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> can
directly import RAW and DNG images. In the process it can optionally
convert RAW images to DNG by integrating the Adobe DNG converter.
(Note, that <span style="font-style: italic;">Adobe DNG Converter</span> is not distributed with <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> but must be downloaded from Adobe and installed separately.)<br>
<br>
By default <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> uses internally the popular module <span style="font-style: italic;">dcraw</span> to convert RAW images into a viewable format (see also <a href="../tasks/import.html#raw">Importing images</a>).
This is done every time when a thumbnail is produced from an image,
when images are viewed or exported. Typically, the conversion process
takes a few seconds. Because new digital cameras are released
frequently, <span style="font-style: italic;">dcraw</span> versions change frequently - more often than ZoRa PD versions. To support the latest digital cameras, <a href="../reference/dcraw.html">new <span style="font-style: italic;">dcraw</span> versions</a> can therefore simply be dropped into the sub folder <code>dropins/ </code>in the <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> installation folder. <br><br>Alternatively, <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> can use the <span style="font-style: italic;">RawTherapee</span> raw converter in batch mode instead of&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">dcraw</span>. The quality should be better than with dcraw, and if you dominantly use <span style="font-style: italic;">RawTherapee</span> to convert your raw images, integrating it with <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> is a good way to keep your image base consistent. Also, on OS X platforms the availability of <span style="font-style: italic;">RawTherapee</span> is better than the availability of <span style="font-style: italic;">dcraw</span>. In addition, <span style="font-style: italic;">RawTherapee</span> offers the possibilty for adding support to new cameras - look <a href="http://rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/Adding_Support_for_New_Raw_Formats">here</a>!<br>
<br>
To set up RAW and DNG conversion go to <a href="../reference/importPrefs.html"><acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import&gt;RAW Conversion*</acronym></a><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span> <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> can
automatically track the relationships between RAW images and their
derived images. You can visualize these relationships through the <a href="../reference/hierarchy.html">Hierarchy view</a>.<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="3R"></a>Raw Recipe Reflection (3R)<br>
</h4>
When developing RAW images, Raw Converters do not modify the original
image. Instead they apply certain transformations to the original image
and store the result in a conventional image format such as TIFF or
JPeG. These transformations (<span style="font-style: italic;">recipes</span>)
are usually stored in separate files, for example in XMP sidecars or in
separate folders, so that later these transformations can be reapplied
or modified without effort.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> is able to
read these recipes and to apply them to the image whenever the image is
converted into a viewable format. This is optional and can be
configured under <a href="../reference/importPrefs.html"><acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import&gt;RAW Conversion*</acronym></a><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>In case that one image has several recipes created with different Raw Converters, <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> will alway use the newest recipe. In the rare case that two Raw Converters share the same recipe file (as is the case between <span style="font-style: italic;">Adobe Camera Raw/Adobe Lightroom</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">BIbble</span>), the priority defined under&nbsp;<acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import&gt;RAW Conversion*</acronym> decides which recipe will be used.<br>
<br>
RAW recipes that were used for deriving other images (such as TIFF or
JPeG images) can automatically be archived within the catalog (<acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import&gt;RAW Conversion*</acronym>). This allows you at a later time, to restore the original recipe. To do so, open the <a href="../reference/hierarchy.html">Hierarchy view</a> on the RAW image (<acronym>Relations&gt;Show Derivatives</acronym>) and double click the derivative. In the following dialog click <abbr>Restore</abbr>.<br><br>Note, however, that the above applies only when using <span style="font-style: italic;">dcraw</span> as raw converter. If you use <span style="font-style: italic;">RawTherapee</span> you have only the options to apply <code>.pp3</code> sidecar recipes or the standard processing profile setup in <span style="font-style: italic;">RawTherapee</span>. Recipes from other raw converters are ignored. The advandage is that the recipe is processed by <span style="font-style: italic;">RawTherapee</span> itself and therefore is 100% identical with <span style="font-style: italic;">RawTherapee</span> conversion results.<br>
<br>
<h4>Advanced Features: CHDK support</h4>
The CHDK is a tool that can be loaded onto an memory card and enables most <span style="font-style: italic;">Canon</span>
consumer cameras - among other things - to deliver RAW and DNG files.
Unfortunately, this RAW format does not contain EXIF data, and the DNG
files only contain an incomplete set of EXIF data. Fortunatly, the
camera also produces an associated JPeG file with a complete set of
EXIF data.<br>
<br>
To obtain the most complete set of metadata with these files, we recommend to work in the following way:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Set up the camera to deliver DNG images (CHDK menu). This allow
you to process these images with most RAW converters (the RAW converter
support for the CHDK propietary RAW format is very limited, indeed.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Set up the camera (CHDK menu) to prefix image names with <code>IMG_</code>.</li>
  <li>When importing those images from the memory card with the <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRA Photo Director</span>, check the option <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling prefix for EXIF transfer </span>under<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advanced Options</span> (see also<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><a href="../reference/importFromDevice.html">Import from device dialog</a>). <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa Photo Director</span> will then import the image from the DNG file but the EXIF data from the associated JPeG file. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
</ul>
