<h2>Reports </h2>

<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Creating a report in ZoRa
PhotoDirector is easy. Just call menu function <acronym>Catalog&gt;Reports...</acronym> .<br>
A wizard guides you through the five steps of
report creation:<br>

<br>

<ol>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Source selection.</span> You may
either start by creating a new report or by selecting an existing
report. To select an existing report simply click the <abbr>Browse...</abbr>
button to display all reports stored in the current catalog. Select one
from the list.<br>
Otherwise, specify a name and a description for the new report. Name
and description will later show up as title and subtitle in the
generated report.<br>
The specify the data source for the report. This may be all images in
the catalog or images from a specified collection.<br>
    <br>
</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mode selection.</span> First
specify one or several values fror the charts y-Axis.&nbsp; You may
select from image count, number of sales and earnings. <br>
Then specify a value category for the x-Axis. This may be</li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The time of day</span>. This
is derived from the IPTC creation data and the EXIF creation date with
precendence of the IPTC date over the EXIF date. The value ranges from
0:00 am to 11:59 pm.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The combined creation date.</span>
This is derived from the IPTC creation data. the EXIF creation date,
and the last file modification date with precendence of the IPTC date
over the EXIF date, and the EXIF date over the file modification date.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Numeric values.</span> When
selecting this option you will be able to select a numeric field as an
x-Axis value source in the next step. A typical example would be the
field "Model age".</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discrete values.</span> When
selecting this option you will be able to select a non-numeric field as
an x-Axis value source in the next step. This can be a field with a
fixed value set (enumeration) such as the field "Light source" or a
field with an unlimited value range such as "Artist".<br>
    </li>
  </ul>Finally,
for discrete values you have the possibilty to specify how to sort the
items on the x-Axis: either use the natural order (no sort), or sort by
name (value), by image count, by sales, or by earnings.<br>
  <br>
 <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Value selection.</span> Here
you
specify a value source for the x-Axis (Numeric and Discrete values
only), a value range, and an interval to determine the number values in
the generated chart (e.g. number of bars). Images outside the value
range will not appear int the report. For discrete values with a fixed
value set you have the possibility to exclude certain values from the
report. You may also specify a threshold. Items with a y-Axis value
below the specified threshold will not appear in the chart but will be
folded into a separate item name "Others".<br>
    <br>
</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chart type selection.</span>
Depending on the specified report mode you can select between a Pie
chart, a Bar chart, a Line chart, a Step chart, and an Area chart.
Depending on that choice you may select additional options such as 3D,
cylindrical (for Bar charts), and cumulated (for date and time
reports). The preview area shows you the effect of these choices. To
keep the responses fast, the preview is limited to data from 50 images.<br>
<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Finished.</span> The report is
generated. By right clicking the finished chart you obtain a menu with
additional options. You may save the chart as a PNG image file or print
it. By selecting Properties you can add further customization to your
chart. You may change&nbsp; titles, labels, colors, fonts and other
properties.<br>
Finally, you have the choice to either store your definitions under the name specified in Step 1 by clicking <abbr>Finish</abbr> or to discard them by clicking <abbr>Cancel</abbr>.<br>
    <br>
