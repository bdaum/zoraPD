<h2>Video concepts </h2>When&nbsp;the <span style="font-style: italic;">Video Support</span> component was installed,<span style="font-style: italic;"> ZoRa PhotoDirector</span>
is able to include video files into the catalog, too. The handling of
video files is quite similar to the handling of photos. However, some
features are not supported for video files.<br><br><h4>Video engine</h4><span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa PhotoDirector</span>
uses the VLC video player (VideoLAN client) as an internal video
engine. VLC is a very robust video engine accepting almost any video
format. <br>VLC is not included in the <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa PhotoDirector</span>
distribution. In many cases you will already have a VLC installation on
your computer. Otherwise you must download and install it. <br>Finally, you must tell <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa PhotoDirector</span> where the VLC executable is found. (<a href="videoPrefs.html"><acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Import&gt;Video</acronym></a>).<h4>Features&nbsp;not supported for video files</h4>
<ul><li>Exhibitions</li><li>Slide show</li><li>Web galleries</li><li>Export to PDF</li><li>Export to photo communities, but there are export function for video communities</li><li>Export to KML</li></ul>

<h4>Remote video files</h4>Other than for images, remote video files are
not supported.<br><br><h4>Metadata</h4>Unfortunately,
there is no universal metadata standard for video file formats similar
to the EXIF metadata for photos. Therefore we treat metadata for video
in the following way:<br><ul><li>Metadata which can be derived from
file properties such as file size, URI, etc, and ZoRa specific metadata
such as rating, privacy, color code, etc, are shown in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Properties</span> group. ZoRa specific metadata can be exported into XMP-sidecars.</li><li>A few image related properties such as frame size are shown in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXIF</span> group.</li><li>Video specific metadata derived from metadata entries embedded in the video stream are shown in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Video</span> group. These entries are strictly read-only.</li><li>Addidtional information such as keywords, categories, locations, etc can be entered in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">IPTC</span> group. This metadata can be exported into XMP-sidecars, too.</li></ul></body></html>
