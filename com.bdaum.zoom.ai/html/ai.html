    <h2>AI Preferences<br>
    </h2>
    Artificial intelligence services are used in<span style="font-style: italic;">
      ZoRa PhotoDirector</span> for image recognition. In particular these
    services are used in the <acronym>Categorize...</acronym> function for
    proposing categories, keywords, and optionally privacy levels, image
    descriptions, and face regions.<br>
    <br>
    The AI preference page collects the currently implemented AI preference
    services within a tabbed folder. A checkbox at the top of the page allows
    you to switch these
    services on or off altogether. <br>
    <br>
    Some services deliver their results in English only. To obtain the results
    in a language of your choice, you must activate the translation
    service. <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa PhotoDirector</span>
    integrates the Microsoft translation service. To activate it, open an
    account at <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft
      Azure</a> and register for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Translate
      Text</span> service. Then enter the obtained <span style="font-weight: bold;">Key1</span>
    or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Key2</span> and the <b>Endpoint </b>into
    the preference page and select an output language. <br>
    <br>
    At the moment of writing Microsoft provides the translation&nbsp; 2 million
    characters
    per month for free. Higher volumes need a payed account.<br>
