<h2>AI Preferences<br>
 </h2>Artificial intelligence services are used in<span style="font-style: italic;"> ZoRa PhotoDirector</span> for image recognition. In particular these service are used in the <acronym>Categorize...</acronym> function for proposing categories, keywords, and optionally privacy levels, image descriptions, and face regions.<br><br>
The AI preference page collects the currently implemented AI preference
services within a tabbed folder. A checkbox at the top of the page allows you to switch these
services on or off altogether. <br>
<br>
Some services deliver their results in English only. To obtain the results
in a language of your choice, you must activate the translation
service. <span style="font-style: italic;">ZoRa PhotoDirector</span> integrates the Microsoft translation service. To activate it, open an account at <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">Microsoft Azure</a> and register for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Translate Text</span> service. Then enter the obtained <span style="font-weight: bold;">Key1</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Key2</span> into the preference page and select an output language. <br>
<br>
At the moment of writing Microsoft provides 10000 translation requests
per month for free (Categories and keywords count as one request,
descriptions as another). Higher volumes need a payed account.<br>
