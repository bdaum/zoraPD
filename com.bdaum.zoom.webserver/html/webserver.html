    <h2>Webserver </h2>
    <p> The built-in webserver is an optional component. If installed
      it can expose images, generated exhibitions and generated webgalleries
      as web contents. The purpose of this webserver is to allow access to the
      catalog contents from
      "small" devices such as mobile phones, projectors, or TV sets, basically
      anything with a webbrowser capable of HTML 5, but
      not to supply a wide public audience.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Please note that</p>
    <ul>
      <li>only images with the required privacy level will be shown.
        Non-JPEG-images and images with a color space other than sRGB are
        converted to JPEG images with a sRGB color space. Video thumbnails are
        shown but videos <span style="font-weight: bold;">are not</span>
        displayed..<br>
      </li>
      <li>only exhibitions with the required privacy level will be
        shown.It is also required that the exhibition was successfully
        generated and exists at the specified output location. If not they will
        be run as a slideshow.</li>
      <li>only web galleries with the required privacy level will be shown.It is
        also required that the web gallery was successfully generated and exists
        at the specified output location. If not they will
        be run as a slideshow.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To configure the webserver go to <acronym>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Webserver</acronym>.</p>
    <br>
